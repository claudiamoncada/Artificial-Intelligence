**Title:** Swarm intelligence for self-organized clustering.

**Authors:** Michael C. Thrun and Alfred Ultsch.

Algorithms that implement populations of agents that interact with each other and perceive their environment can exhibit emergent behavior, such as self-organization and swarm intelligence. Here we present a swarm system, called Databionic swarm (DBS), which is able to adapt to high-dimensional data structures characterized by distance and/or density-based structures in data space. It is based on clustering algorithms, which aims to group objects in a dataset according to their similarity. They also use the Swarm module which combines swarm intelligence or self-organization concepts with non-cooperative game theory. This game consists of rules based on the movements of the bots. Each bot seeks its best reward by moving across the grid or staying in its current position. 

Equilibrium is achieved when no bot leads to a better reward. Once agent self-organization is complete, the output of the Pswarm algorithm is a scatter plot of projected points. The second module is a parameter-free high-dimensional data visualization technique. The third module provides a clustering method that can be verified by visualization. The purpose of this scatter plot is a visualization of distance and density based structures, which is often used in cluster analysis. In addition, the bots conform to natural features such as homogeneity, locality and collision avoidance. In theory, data points that are in the same cluster should have similar properties and/or characteristics, while data points in different clusters should have very different properties and/or characteristics.
